There are many different FBO implementations on the openframeworks site that is publically posted. 

You were able to get this addon here: 
http://addons.openframeworks.cc/projects/show/ofxfbotexture

But here is where you might want to start, it has the same header ours had but with different
implementations:

Here is a more recent FBO posting, however the header and implementation is different from 
what we used so you would have to modify how the warper is integrated into the fbo addon.
